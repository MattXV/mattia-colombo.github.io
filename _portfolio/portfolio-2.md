- Developed a Neural Network for automatically assigning materials to scene geometry

![Material Tagging System](../../images/applied-segmentation.jpg)

- This network works by inferring from framebuffers and projecting materials into the scene

- I developed an extension that works directly on texture data

![Material Classifier](../../images/patch-classifier.jpg)

- This doesn't use framebuffers, and is trained on reconstructed environments

- Allowing automatic tagging of materials in scanned geometry
