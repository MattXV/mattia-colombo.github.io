- Programmed a rendering pipeline to perform acoustic rendering
- The aim was to simulate soundfields of scanned spaces, approximating their physical counterparts
- I built a ray tracer to approximate reverb, calculating absorption in surfaces

- I compared it to existing renderers, like the wave-based Project Acoustics

- And compared it against real soundfields by taking measurements
